# rails_application_demo
Ruby on Rails based application that allows a user to check their visa status in Germany. 



How to Run : 

1.http://localhost:3000/new_post : This will lead you to a form. 
2. Please note : kindly enter a unique email ID every time you try the form. (This functionality can be removed if needed)
3. Once you submit this form, you will go to http://localhost:3000/create_post where you can immediately view your results! 


Bugs :

Unique email ID needed every time you submit the form.
HTML form should have a forced submit on each entry which is not the case right now.
